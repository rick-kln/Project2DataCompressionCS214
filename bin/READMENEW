Place all included files in the main test directory!
*The updated tests test your program against all 29 files included <- not the same as tests.py
*There is an exception to the 29 test rule, made only for the BurrowsWheeler encoding as well as the GZ test
*This can easily be changed, replace the original file list with the one at the top
*tests_updated.py will tell you when a test failed due to a no run, 
 this could either mean an exception was thrown by your program or the 
 java runtime could not locate certain dependencies / classes. fix this and try again.
*Use tests_updated.py as you would tests.py.

In addition, to compare your program's compression to ubuntu/GNU gzip compression 
do the following (only do this if your program has passed all other checks!!):

exectue runOnce.sh
then
execute python gzipratio.py

this gzipratio will always be the same
