Place all included files in the main test directory!
*The updated tests test your program against all 29 files included <- not the same as tests.py
*tests_updated.py will tell you when a test failed due to a no run, 
 this could either mean an exception was thrown by your program or the 
 java runtime could not locate certain dependencies / classes. fix this and try again.
*Use tests_updated.py as you would tests.py.

In addition, to compare your program's compression to ubuntu/GNU gzip compression 
do the following (only do this if your program has passed all other checks!!):

exectue runOnce.sh
then
execute python gzipratio.py

each gzipratio will always be the same
