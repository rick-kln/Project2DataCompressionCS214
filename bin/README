Extract the archive into the same directory as your class files. Run with

    python tests.py <algorithm> <direction>

where <algorithm> must be one of "BW" (Burrows-Wheeler), "MTF" (Move-to-front) or "GZ" (Gzip) and <direction> must be one of "-" (encoding) or "+" (decoding).

For example, the command

    python tests.py BW -

will run the test suite for Burrows-Wheeler encoding.
